It is typically used when a problem is encountered and the developer wants to stop the execution of the code and pass the problem on to another part of the application.
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an error in Java?,An error in Java is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. Errors are typically external to the application and indicate that the application is in an unstable state.
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an exception handler in Java?,"An exception handler in Java is a block of code that handles an exception when it occurs. It is used to catch an exception thrown by a try block and perform some action, such as logging the exception or displaying an error message."
Exception Handling,Hard,What is a custom exception in Java?,A custom exception in Java is a user-defined exception that extends the Exception class or one of its subclasses. It is used to create an exception that is specific to the application or domain and to provide additional information about the error that occurred.
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an exception chaining in Java?,"Exception chaining in Java is the process of linking one exception to another to provide additional context about the error that occurred. It allows for more detailed information to be passed along with an exception, making it easier to diagnose and fix problems in an application."
Exception Handling,Hard,What is a try-with-resources block in Java?,A try-with-resources block in Java is a special type of try block that declares resources that are automatically closed at the end of the block. It simplifies the process of managing resources and helps to avoid resource leaks and other related problems.
Exception Handling,Hard,What is a throw vs rethrow in Java?,"In Java, a throw statement is used to explicitly throw an exception, while a rethrow statement is used to propagate an exception up the call stack. A rethrow statement is used within a catch block to re-throw the exception to the next level of exception handling."
Exception Handling,Hard,What is a nested try-catch block in Java?,"A nested try-catch block in Java is a try-catch block that is placed within another try-catch block. It is used to handle exceptions that occur within the catch block of an outer try-catch block, allowing for more fine-grained exception handling."
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an exception propagation in Java?,Exception propagation in Java is the process of passing an exception up the call stack to be handled by an exception handler. It is used to handle exceptions that occur within a method that cannot be handled locally and must be passed up to the calling method for handling.
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an exception stack unwinding in Java?,"Exception stack unwinding in Java is the process of unwinding the call stack to find an appropriate exception handler when an exception is thrown. It involves searching for the first catch block that can handle the exception, and then executing that catch block."
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an exception propagation and its types in Java?,"In Java, there are two types of exception propagation: checked and unchecked. Checked exceptions must be declared in the method signature or caught in a try-catch block, while unchecked exceptions do not have to be declared or caught."
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an exception hierarchy in Java?,"The exception hierarchy in Java is a class hierarchy that defines the relationship between exception classes. At the top of the hierarchy is the Throwable class, which is the parent class of all exceptions and errors in Java."
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an exception filter in Java?,"An exception filter in Java is a feature introduced in Java 9 that allows for more precise control over which exceptions are caught by a catch block. It is used to filter exceptions based on their type or other criteria, allowing for more fine-grained exception handling."
Exception Handling,Hard,What is a try-catch-finally block with return statement?,"A try-catch-finally block with a return statement executes the code in the try block and if an exception occurs, the code in the catch block is executed. Finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. If there is a return statement in try or catch block, it will be executed before the finally block is executed."
Exception Handling,Hard,What is a try-catch block with multiple catch statements?,"A try-catch block with multiple catch statements allows us to catch different types of exceptions that may occur in the try block. The catch blocks are executed in order of declaration, and the first catch block that matches the thrown exception is executed."
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an exception handling best practice in Java?,Some best practices for exception handling in Java are: 1) Handle exceptions as close to the source as possible 2) Provide enough information about the exception 3) Don’t ignore exceptions 4) Don’t catch exceptions that you can’t handle 5) Use specific exceptions rather than generic ones

We can use try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions in threads. It is also important to handle exceptions that may occur when synchronizing threads.
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an exception handling in lambda expressions in Java?,"Lambda expressions can throw exceptions. To handle exceptions in lambda expressions, we can use a try-catch block inside the lambda expression or propagate the exception to the calling method using throws keyword."
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an exception handling in streams in Java?,"When using streams in Java, we can use the try-catch block to handle exceptions that may occur when processing elements in the stream. It is also possible to propagate exceptions to the calling method using the throws keyword."
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an exception handling in servlets in Java?,Exception handling in servlets involves handling exceptions that may occur during request processing. We can use try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions in servlets. It is also important to provide meaningful error messages to the users.
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an exception handling in spring framework in Java?,"Spring framework provides several ways to handle exceptions, such as using @ExceptionHandler annotation, HandlerExceptionResolver interface, and @ControllerAdvice annotation. We can also define our own exception classes and handlers in Spring."
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an exception handling in Java 8 features?,"Java 8 introduced new features for handling exceptions, such as lambda expressions and functional interfaces. We can also use the Optional class to handle null values that may cause NullPointerExceptions."
Exception Handling,Hard,What is an exception handling in JavaFX?,"Exception handling in JavaFX involves handling exceptions that may occur in the UI thread or worker threads. We can use the try-catch block to handle exceptions in JavaFX, and also use the Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler interface to handle uncaught exceptions in worker threads."
