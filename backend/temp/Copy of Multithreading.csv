Multithreading,Medium,What is a monitor in Java?,"In Java, a monitor is a synchronization construct that allows multiple threads to synchronize access to a shared resource. A monitor consists of a lock and a condition variable, which allows threads to wait for a signal before accessing the shared resource."
Multithreading,Medium,What is a read-write lock in Java?,"A read-write lock in Java is a synchronization construct that allows multiple threads to have concurrent read-only access to a shared resource, but only one thread to have write access at a time. Read-write locks are used to improve concurrency and performance in multi-threaded environments."
Multithreading,Medium,What is a semaphore in Java?,A semaphore is a synchronization mechanism that controls access to a shared resource through the use of a count. It provides a way for multiple threads to acquire or release access to the shared resource.
Multithreading,Medium,What is a countdown latch in Java?,"A countdown latch is a synchronization mechanism that allows one or more threads to wait for a set of operations to complete. It works by maintaining a count that is decremented each time an operation completes, and threads can wait for the count to reach zero before continuing."
Multithreading,Medium,What is a cyclic barrier in Java?,"A cyclic barrier is a synchronization mechanism that allows multiple threads to wait for each other to reach a certain point in their execution before continuing. It works by creating a barrier that blocks threads until a certain number of threads have reached it, at which point the barrier is released and the threads can continue."

Multithreading,Medium,What is a concurrent hashmap in Java?,"A concurrent hashmap is a thread-safe implementation of the hashmap data structure that allows multiple threads to access and modify the map concurrently without the need for explicit synchronization. It achieves this through the use of a mechanism called lock striping, which divides the map into multiple segments, each of which is locked independently."
Multithreading,Medium,What is a completion service in Java?,"A completion service is a higher-level concurrency utility that allows you to submit tasks to an executor service and retrieve their results in the order that they complete, rather than in the order that they were submitted. It is useful for managing the results of asynchronous computations and can simplify the code required for managing the completion of tasks."
Multithreading,Medium,What is parallel streams in Java?,"Parallel streams are a feature introduced in Java 8 that allow you to perform stream operations in parallel, automatically utilizing multiple cores and threads. They provide a convenient way to parallelize stream processing without requiring you to manually manage threads and synchronization."
Multithreading,Medium,What is a fork-join framework in Java?,"The fork-join framework is a high-level concurrency utility introduced in Java 7 that provides a way to perform parallel computations on arrays or other data structures. It works by recursively dividing the data into smaller chunks and executing them in parallel, then combining the results. It is useful for performing tasks that can be broken down into smaller, independent subtasks, such as sorting or searching."
Multithreading,Medium,What is a thread-local random number generator in Java?,A thread-local random number generator is a thread-safe implementation of a random number generator that provides a separate instance of the generator for each thread that uses it. This can improve performance and reduce contention for shared resources when generating random numbers in a multithreaded context.
Multithreading,Medium,What is a thread-safe queue with blocking operations in Java?,"A thread-safe queue with blocking operations is a data structure that allows multiple threads to add and remove elements from a shared queue, while also providing blocking operations that allow threads to wait until elements are available or space is freed up. Examples include the BlockingQueue interface and its implementations, such as ArrayBlockingQueue and LinkedBlockingQueue."
Multithreading,Medium,What is a thread-safe lazy initialization in Java?,"Thread-safe lazy initialization is a technique used to create a singleton object that is initialized lazily, on demand, and is also safe to use in a multithreaded context. This can be achieved using various synchronization techniques, such as double-checked locking or initialization-on-demand holder idiom."
